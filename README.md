## Hi there! 👋

I'm Elena, recent graduate of the University of Vienna with a Master's in Business Analytics.

My passion lies at the intersection of **data science**, **machine learning**, and **customer analysis**. I am deeply fascinated by the narratives that numbers and statistics reveal about the world, human behavior, and societal trends.

Current Fascinations:

- 🚀 **Transformers in Time Series Analysis**: Commonly used in language tasks, I love how versatile they actually are and how well they work for all kinds of sequential data
- 🤝 **The Wisdom of the Crowd Effect**: The way collective decision-making can enhance prediction accuracy, even when individual estimates are varied
- 🔍 **Impact of Recommendation Systems**: How these systems, while enhancing user experience, can inadvertently reinforce biases and limit exposure to diverse perspectives
- ✏️ **Doodling for Infographics**: Exploring my creative side with creating visually engaging and informative infographics from cratch
